# Predicting COVID Pneumonia from X-ray

This notebook is the result of the work carried out by the research team of the Image Processing, Computer Vision, and Interactive Applications Research Group (Pixel Group) at the State University of Mato Grosso, focusing on the theme "Formation of a Cooperation network in Mato Grosso on machine learning and image analysis." The project was conceived by researchers Jeniffer Luz (Researcher) and Scenio Araujo (Researcher), under the coordination of Professor Carlos Gulo. It also involves the participation of researchers Caio de Abreu and Juvenal Neto.

It is noteworthy that this notebook serves as a validation of the entire project's progress, with the theme being presented at scientific events such as the XII Computer on the Beach, receiving awards, and having articles published on renowned platforms, including ResearchGate (DOI: 10.14210/cotb.v12.p523-524).

As a co-author of the code shared on my network for the purpose of presenting academic development, I would like to emphasize that the work offers various possibilities for improvement, as there is always room for enhancements and additions.

We also express our gratitude for the database used in the project, developed by researcher WEI HAO KHOONG, which is available for public use on the Kaggle platform.
